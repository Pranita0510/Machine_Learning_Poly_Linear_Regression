🤖 Machine Learning Model Implementation:

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of machine learning models on a cleaned and preprocessed dataset. It includes model training, evaluation, and performance comparison using Python libraries like Scikit-learn.

✅ Key Steps Included:

Importing libraries and loading the dataset

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

Implementing classification/regression models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)

Model training and prediction

Evaluating model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, etc.)

Comparing results and drawing insights

🛠 Requirements:

Python 3.x

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📁 Dataset:

Ensure the dataset used is included or linked if loaded externally.

🎯 Use Case:

Great for practicing end-to-end ML workflows from preprocessing to model evaluation. Suitable for beginners and intermediate learners.
